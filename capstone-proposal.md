Name of Student: Ashe Urban

Name of Project: Dine Together

Project's Purpose or Goal: Assist users via a social style platform with the following:

1. Making organizing dinners out with other people easy
2. Local restauant exposure

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

My minimum viable product for this project will be a react based app with a robust UI that allows users to login, update a profile, and create a wishlist of places they want to eat by connecting with the OpenTable API or the google places API.

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

react
google places API
firebase
still researching other needs...

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

I would love to start creating a feed of different user's activity, a shared wishlist for groups of users, and the absolute dream would be to get access to OpenTable API so that reservations could be made through the app -- in addition to gaining access to other amazing features like being able to search for reservation availability at different restaurants by group size.

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

OpenTable API

Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
I think I will need some help keeping this simple, would love any advice I can get!
