  will try to use 'dine_in' boolean to filter for restaurants that would be applicable and 'locality'.

  would like to start by simply returning a list of restaurants with the following fields:
         name
         formatted address or address component
         dine_in

* 2:00:  looking for endpoint documentation and how to use it...

Quick Overview:
